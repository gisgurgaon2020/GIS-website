                  <p>For Parent Engagement we follow our research-based 3-a-day approach at GEMS International School Gurgaon. At GEMS schools we value our parent's contribution to their child. Let us tell you about our 3 a day parent engagement program.  Every GEMS school is unique, yet every school we run is committed to working closely with you, the parents. Your children may be the most important people we work with, but it’s you who make their education a true success.<br><br>All over the UAE and beyond, our schools are inviting parents into the classroom, getting you involved in both teaching and learning. Working with so many diverse cultures and communities means that we have a whole world of mums, dads, guardians and carers to draw on for expertise and support. We love to make use of your amazing resources. That’s why we regularly run carefully developed parental engagement and parental involvement activities and events in our schools. </p>
                  <div class="container">
                     <h3><strong>Parental involvement</strong></h3>
                     <p>Bake sales, charity fundraisers, cultural activities, reading time – there are so many ways for you to get involved in your child’s education at your GEMS school.Getting hands-on doesn’t just show your support for your child, it’s also a brilliant way to get involved in school life; meeting <a href="https://gemsinternationalschoolgurgaon.com/gems-teachers/">GEMS teachers</a>, talking to other <a href="https://gemsinternationalschoolgurgaon.com/gems-parents/">GEMS parents</a> and finding out what your student’s classmates are up to.</p>
                     <p>Thanks to the involvement of GEMS families, our schools are lively hubs in their local communities. Read some of our school stories to see some of the ways GEMS families get involved!</p>

                  <h3><strong>Parental engagement</strong></h3>
                  <p>There’s more to getting involved in your child’s education than helping with school events. If you want to make sure your child keeps learning even after they’ve left the school gates, we’re proud promoters of strong parental engagement.</p>
                  <p>Parental engagement is a little different to parental involvement. It’s all about taking learning out of the classroom and keeping it going at home.</p>
                  <p class="text-primary">International research shows that parents who are actively engaged in their child’s learning can give them an extra two to three years worth of schooling on top of their classroom experience. And it’s not all about academic success either. In fact, good parental engagement can help your child learn even better social skills, an essential accomplishment for the future.</p>
                  <p>Every parent, regardless of culture, language or experience, has something special to offer their child. Engaged parents value education. They are strong role models of learning. All it takes is a 3-a-day approach:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li><strong>Talk about learning</strong></li>
                     <li><strong>Share learning</strong></li>
                     <li><strong>Encourage learning</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text-primary"><strong>Parent engagement 3-a-day Approach at GEMS International School Gurgaon.</strong></p>
                  <strong>What does the research say?</strong><br><br>
                  Research has shown that the single biggest reason a child does well at school is the support of parents who take a real, active and consistent interest in their child’s education at home. The research suggests that a parent who is actively and consistently engaged in their child’s learning can add the equivalent of two to three years of additional education over their school career. This is precisely why we’re so keen to promote the importance of parental engagement.<br><br>
                  <strong>Every parent has something to offer</strong><br><br>
                  Conversation is at the heart of positive parental engagement. It’s not necessarily about sitting with your child and helping them with their homework. Every parent, regardless of their culture, language or experience, can talk to their child and show an interest in their learning. By asking questions, listening and encouraging your child with praise and direction, you can reinforce learning and become an active partner in the educational process. It can be as easy as 3-a-day. </p>

                  Parents and guardians should be at the heart of any child’s education. While teachers are there at the front of the classroom, it’s the family you come home to who provide an essential foundation for academic success. That’s why we believe that parental involvement in school is so important. Research regularly demonstrates just how essential parent and caregiver engagement is to an excellent education. To make sure our pupils are given the very best start, our leading private schools work hard to develop strong partnerships with the parents and guardians of our diverse body of students. We’re committed to encouraging supportive, hands-on parenting in all GEMS Schools.
                  <h6 class="text-primary mt-3">Close communication</h6>
                  <p class="text-justify"> Close communication is at the core of our partnership approach. Keeping guardians in the loop regarding their child’s progress is an essential part of what we do. From consultation evenings and written reports, to an “open door” policy which ensures parents can speak with us at any stage, we keep those all-important channels of communication wide open.  Make an appointment today to speak one-to-one with any member of our teaching staff in confidence.</p>
                  <h6 class="text-primary">Parental partnership</h6>
                  <p>Whether it’s keeping our campus tidy, or planting new greenery in our grounds, there are all sorts of opportunities for parental involvement at GEMS Schools. We regularly welcome parents and guardians onto campus to help nurture a sense of community among teachers, parents and students.</p>
