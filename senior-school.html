        <div class="container text-justify">
          <p>
            In the Senior school, students’ intellectual, aesthetic, physical
            and cultural growth is strengthened and extended to enable students
            to fit into any international background. The Secondary curriculum
            is broad-based and robust, that provides students with skill sets
            and balanced knowledge of key subjects, as well as effective
            critical thinking and communication skills. Students develop vital
            skills that allow them to be successful across all subject areas and
            assist with future challenges at university and in the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Through these years, students are guided on their career choices
              beyond the school environment. The school ranked #1 in the
              Education World School Grand Jury Awards, in the ‘Career
              Counselling’ category for the support provided to students during
              the crucial years that determine their path in life.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Consistent connections made to current global and real-life
            situations enable students to articulate the relevance of their
            learning. Very effective communication and enquiry skills is
            demonstrated during learning through group discussions, student
            opinion and by challenging their peers. As independent and
            inquisitive learners, students go beyond classroom learning to
            enhance their critical thinking skills. The academic focus equips
            students for research-based higher education by developing
            21st-century skills, whereas the exposure to co-scholastic
            activities ensures the personal & social development of students.

          <p>
            In addition to the standard CBSE curriculum, we firmly believe in
            holistic education and therefore we are committed to developing
            extended and alternate learning experiences through webinars, MUNs,
            Student Exchange Programs etc. We believe these opportunities
            encourage further challenges outside the classroom, nurturing,
            developing and growing specific interests and talents, creating
            further opportunities for students to develop and demonstrate our
            school’s core values.

            The Secondary School Curriculum
          </h4>
          <h5>English Language & Literature</h5>
          <p>
            The course aims, essentially, at promoting the higher-order language
            skills, develop greater confidence and proficiency in the use of the
            language skills, build communicative competence in various lexicons
            of English and develop ability and acquire knowledge required in
            order to engage in independent reflection and enquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking and listening skills better the interactive competence,
            fluency, pronunciation and language accuracy. Writing skill stresses
            on the ability to seek relevant information, lodge complaints,
            express gratitude, render apology, draft papers to present, express
            opinions, facts, arguments and constructing accurate sentence
            structures. Reading skill is developed to create independent
            thinking individuals with the ability to not only create their own
            knowledge, but also critically interpret, analyse and evaluate it
            with objectivity and fairness. Independent thinkers become capable
            of taking their own decisions in life rationally.
          </p>
          <h5>Social Studies</h5>
          <p>
            Social Studies is the interdisciplinary integration of social
            sciences and humanitarian concepts in order to teach students
            problem solving and decision-making skills, so they may become
            proactive citizens in their communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contemporary Social studies in secondary school is all about
            tracking changes around the globe. Central to this are students
            should be made aware how and why events are taking place, and how
            the present world in which we live is evolving. Students learn about
            the emergence of contemporary world behaviors, historical events,
            geographical distributions, and political happenings globally.
          </p>
          <h5>Science</h5>
          <p>
            The present Science syllabus plays an important role in developing
            abilities in cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains in
            children. It augments the spirit of enquiry, creativity, objectivity
            and aesthetic sensibility. It has been designed around seven broad
            themes viz. Food; materials, The World of The Living, How Things
            Work, Moving Things, People and Ideas, Natural Phenomenon and
            Natural Resources. At this stage, while science is still a common
            subject, the disciplines of Physics, Chemistry and Biology begin to
            emerge. The students are exposed to experiences based on hands on
            activities as well as modes of reasoning that are typical of the
            subject. Our syllabus engages young students with exciting material
            and experiences, motivates them to learn and pursue the sciences in
            the senior grades. Teaching technological literacy, critical
            thinking and problem-solving through science education gives
            students the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in school and
            beyond.
          </p>
          <h5>Mathematics</h5>
          <p>
            The main goal of Mathematics education is the 'mathematisation' of a
            child's thinking. Clarity of thought and pursuing assumptions to
            logical conclusions is central to the mathematical enterprise. The
            skills to handle abstractions and an approach to problem solving
            comes along with it. It also includes a child’s understanding of the
            basic structure of Mathematics: Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry,
            Trigonometry, Commercial mathematics, Calculus, Mensuration,
            Statistics, Probability - all of which offer a methodology for
            abstraction, structuration and generalization. The curriculum also
            provides students with an appreciation of the wide variety of the
            application of Mathematics and equips them with the basic tools that
            enable such application. It also facilitates acquisition of 21st
            Century Skills and enhances self and social awareness among
            students.
          </p>
          <h5>Second Language (Hindi & French)</h5>
          <p>
            Within languages, our students gain the ability to communicate while
            focusing upon listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.
            Through their studies they will also gain an insight into, and a
            positive attitude towards, other cultures and practices. Students
            also develop the skills to analyze texts to extract meaning through
            gist and inference, improve memory skills as well as expressing and
            justifying their points of view, attitudes and emotions.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-primary text-center">
            Senior Secondary School Curriculum
          </h4>
          <br />
          <h5>Subjects offered in Grades 11 & 12</h5>
          <p class="text-primary">
            We believe in empowering students through flexibility in the choice
            of subjects at the senior secondary level. The students can design
            their own courses for study, without having to confine to the
            rigidity of silos like – arts, humanities, sciences etc. We are glad
            that this thinking is now also completely aligned with the NEP 2020

        <h5>English Core</h5>
        <p>
          The Higher Secondary stage will be a preparation for the university,
          where a high degree of proficiency in English is required and it also
          is a preparation for entry into the professional domain. The Core
          Course caters to both by promoting the language skills required for
          academic study as well as the language skills required for the
          workplace. Throughout the course, learners will be encouraged to
          practise their skills in close reading through the study of literary
          extracts and unseen texts; developing skills of analysis and
          interpretation of texts, alongside their expression of personal
          response to the texts studied.
        </p>
        <h5>Mathematics</h5>
        <p>
          The NCERT curriculum of Mathematics encompasses various facets of
          concepts; those related to arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry,
          algebra, commercial mathematics, calculus, mensuration, statistics,
          and probability. The skill to calculate and organize and the ability
          to apply this knowledge and other acquired skills in their daily life
          comes along with it. It also includes understanding of the principles
