               <p class="text-justify">At GEMS Education we care about a values-led education and seek to encourage students to grow and develop their personal and interpersonal qualities. A variety of initiatives, designed to instill values in students, have been rolled out across GEMS schools, with teachers, student and parents all actively involved. The GEMS Jewels of Kindness & Respect initiative has been created to encourage students to think about showing all the qualities of kindness, such as respect, empathy, helpfulness, and compassion, to their friends, family and wider community with the belief that children learn best when there is close collaboration between home and school on core values.</p>
               <br>
               <h5 class="bg-light text-center">Did you know?</h5>
               <p class="bg-light my-2">In 2018, GEMS enlisted the help of Michele Borba, an internationally acclaimed expert and author on children, teens, parenting, bullying and moral development.</p>
               <br>
               <h5 class="text-center">How does it work?</h5>
               <p><strong>Being kind is easy and doesn’t cost a penny!</strong></p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Children carry out acts of kindness towards parents and family members while out and about and at home.</li>
                  <li>Teachers ask parents to inform them of their child’s act of kindness.</li>
                  <li>
                     The school rewards and celebrates each act through:
                     <ol>
                        <li><em>Sticker collections and sticker books (recommended for Primary students)</em></li>
                        <li><em>GEMS Jewels of Kindness certificates</em></li>
                        <li><em>GEMS Jewels of Kindness camel mascots – students are invited to take the mascot home for a few days (recommended for Primary students)</em></li>
                        <li><em>GEMS Jewels of Kindness pins (recommended for Secondary students)</em></li>
                        <li><em>Publicity in school newsletters and similar publications, or displays in the school foyer</em></li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Parents showcase their child’s kindness via social media and, in this way, kindness spreads</li>
               </ol>
               <p>While the importance of kindness, respect, empathy, helpfulness and compassion is taught and promoted within all our schools, we want to ensure that these qualities extend beyond the school environment and continue to be developed and reflected at home. To that end, the GEMS Jewels of Kindness initiative is a means of encouraging children to be kind to their parents, grandparents and siblings, and in turn society as a whole. Rolled out across all GEMS schools, the programme is also a celebration of all the good deeds and acts of kindness being carried out by GEMS students.</p>

                     <p><em>Every parent wants the very best for their child. The best opportunities, the best experiences and the very best education. But how can you be sure that the teaching your child receives is of the highest quality? That’s where external accreditation comes in.</em></p>
                     <p><strong>GEMS accreditations</strong></p>
                     <p>Our international schools teach a diverse range of curricula to students at every stage of their educational journey. To give you confidence in our expertise in every syllabus at every level, we’d like to talk to you about the international accreditations and affiliations we have to our name.</p>
                     <p>We’re very proud of the accreditations GEMS schools have achieved. Each accreditation and affiliation is a seal of approval from the best international educational bodies. From AQA international accreditation to NCA accreditation and central board of secondary education affiliation; our awards and relationships speak volumes about the high standard of education available through our schools. You can take a look at a number of our accreditations from global bodies below.</span></p>
                     <p><strong>What does accreditation really mean?</strong></p>
                     <p>So what do all these acronyms and accreditations really mean for your child’s experience in the classroom?</p>
                     <p>School accreditation is an important type of quality assurance. From government organisations to exam boards, expert external bodies regularly evaluate the performance of schools teaching in their country or teaching their syllabus. An accreditation is a clear indication that their own, internal standards are being met. This means you and your child can be confident that they’re receiving an education which is of the highest standard.</p>
                     <p><strong>Moving schools   accreditation</strong></p>
                     <p>The reassurance that your child is receiving the best possible education is important wherever you travel. But for families who are transferring schools or moving countries, looking closely at accreditation is even more essential.</p>
                     <p>GEMS International School is affiliated with<strong> CBSE AFFILIATION NO: 530889</strong></p>
                     <p>With little local knowledge to rely upon, the reputation and quality of prospective schools must be proven with official recognition from the right bodies. Look for accreditation or affiliation with the body responsible for your child’s syllabus, check for recognition from any relevant exam boards and make sure your prospective school has approval from their national government educational organisation.</p>
                     <p><strong>Our Awards</strong></p>
                     <p>At GEMS, we run great schools that set a benchmark for quality education. We know this because all GEMS Schools are accredited and/or affiliated to internationally acclaimed education organisations. It’s the reassurance any family wants for their child’s future.
